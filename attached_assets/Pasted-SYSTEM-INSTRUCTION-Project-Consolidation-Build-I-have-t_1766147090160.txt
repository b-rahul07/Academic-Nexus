SYSTEM INSTRUCTION: Project Consolidation & Build

I have two data sources in this environment:

A GitHub Repository (Base Code).

A Local Uploaded Folder (Contains the most recent, critical changes).

PHASE 1: SMART MERGE (Crucial)

Action: recursively copy all files from the Uploaded Folder into the main project directory.

Conflict Rule: If a file exists in both, OVERWRITE the Repo version with the Uploaded Folder version. The Uploaded Folder is the "Source of Truth."

Cleanup: After merging, delete the separate Uploaded Folder to keep the workspace clean.

Dependencies: Run npm install immediately after merging to ensure all packages (gsap, react-icons, react-router-dom, @supabase/supabase-js) are available.

PHASE 2: PROJECT ARCHITECTURE (The "NEXUS" System) Once merged, ensure the app follows this exact architecture. If any part is missing or broken after the merge, fix it immediately.

1. The Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS.

Theme: "Executive Dark Mode" (bg-black/90) with Glassmorphism (white/10, backdrop-blur).

Navigation: A floating, horizontal "CardNav" dock (from React Bits) pinned to the top center.

Database: Supabase (Connection via VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in Secrets).

2. The "Indian College" Role Hierarchy

Login: The landing page must ONLY show 3 Login Cards: Student, Faculty, Admin.

Secondary Roles: After login, check user.additional_roles from Supabase to unlock features:

Faculty: 'Seating Manager' (unlocks Seating Algo), 'Club Coordinator' (unlocks Event Approvals), 'Course Incharge' (unlocks Syllabus Upload).

Student: 'Club President/VP' (unlocks Event Creation).

PHASE 3: FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST Verify and implement these specific modules based on the merged code:

A. Admin Dashboard:

User Mgmt: Table to toggle 'Detained' status (Red Row) and assign 'Seating/Club' duties.

Bulk Upload: A file dropzone that uses Regex to match PDF filenames (e.g., R101.pdf) to Student IDs and generates a "Success/Fail" report.

B. Student Dashboard:

Nav: 3 Horizontal Cards (Academics, Exams, Campus).

Smart Hall Ticket: Block download if academic_status === 'Detained' (Red Alert). Allow download if hall_ticket_status === 'Mapped'.

Mind Map: A React Flow visualization that generates study nodes from a text syllabus input.

C. Faculty Dashboard:

Nav: 3 Horizontal Cards (Classroom, Exam Duty, Affairs).

Seating Algo: A button that fetches all Active students (filtering out Detained ones) and randomly assigns them to rooms.

PHASE 4: EXECUTION

Fix any "404 Not Found" routing errors by ensuring App.jsx uses wildcard routes (/student/*, /admin/*, /faculty/*).

Start the dev server (npm run dev) and ensure the "Glassmorphism" UI renders correctly.
